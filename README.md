Description
-----------

VariantBam is a tool to extract/count specific sets of sequencing reads from NGS sequencing files. To save money, 
disk space and I/O, one may not want to store an entire BAM on disk. In many cases, it would be more efficient to store only those read-pairs or
reads who intersect some region around the variant locations. Alternatively, if your scientific question is focused on only one aspect of the data (eg breakpoints), many 
reads can be removed without losing the information relevant to the problem. 

##### Example Use 1
Whole-genome analysis has been conducted on a BAM, generating VCF and MAF files. Ideally, these regions could be manually inspected
or reanalyzed without having to keep the entire BAM. Running VariantBam to extract only reads that overlap these events will allow
these regions to be rapidly queried, without having to keep the full BAM record.
```
### Extract all read PAIRS that interset with a variant from a VCF
variant $bam -l myvcf.vcf -r all -o mini.bam
```

##### Example Use 2
In situations where the sequencing or library preparation quality is low, it may be advantageous
to remove poor quality reads before starting the analysis train. VariantBam handles this by optionally taking into
account Phred base-qualities when making a decision whether to keep a sequencing read. For instance, one might 
only be interested in high quality MAPQ 0 or clipped reads. VariantBam can be 
setup to apply unique Phred filters to different regions or across the entire genome, all with one-pass. 
```
### Extract only high quality reads with >= 50 bases of phred >=4 and MAPQ >= 1 and not duplicated/hardclip/qcfail
variant $bam -r 'phred[4,100];length[50,1000];mapq[1,60];!duplicate;!hardclip!qcfail' -o mini.bam
```
##### Example Use 3
An NGS tool operates only on a subset of the reads (eg. structural variant caller using only clipped/discordant reads). Running VariantBam
to keep only these reads allows the tool to run much faster. This is particurlaly useful for facilitating a more rapid "build/test" cycle.
```
### Extract clipped, discordant, unmapped and indel reads
variant $bam  -r 'global@nbases[0,0];!hardclip;!supplementary;!duplicate;!qcfail;phred[4,100];%region@WG%discordant[0,1000];mapq[1,1000]%mapq[1,1000];clip[5,1000]%ins[1,1000];mapq[1,100]%del[1,1000];mapq[1,1000]' -o mini.bam
```
##### Example Use 4
A user wants to profile a BAM for quality. They would like to count the number of clipped reads in a BAM file, so long
as those reads have sufficient optical quality and mapping quality. VariantBam run with the -x flag for "counting only" 
will accomplish this.
```
### 
variant $bam -r 'clip[5,100];phred[4,100];mapq[10,100]' -x counts.tsv
```
##### Example Use 5
A team is only interested in variants in known cancer genes, and would like to analyze thousands of exomes and genomes. Running 
VariantBam to extract reads from only these genes, and sending the BAM files to compressed CRAM provides sufficient data reduction
to allow all of the relevant data to be stored on disk.
```
### Grab only reads from predefined regions. Strip unneccessary tags and convert to CRAM for maximum compression
variant $bam -g mygenes.bed -r all -C -o mini.cram -s BI,OQ
```
##### Example Use 6
A research team would like to extract only reads matching a certain motifs, but only if they have high optical quality. 
VariantBam with the ``motif`` rule will accomplish this with rapid O(n) efficiency for an arbitrarily large motif dictionary (where ``n`` is
the length of a read)
```
### 
variant $bam -r 'motif[mymotifs.txt];phred[4,100];length[20,1000]' -o mini.bam
```
Tool comparison
---------------

In comparing with other avaiable BAM filtering tools, VariantBam provides the following novel features:

> 1. The ability to filter specifically on read clipping, orientation and insert size (all important for structural variation), while taking into account the per-base phred quality.
> 2. Use of interval trees to efficiently determine if a read or read mate overlaps a region.
> 3. The ability to provide different rules for different regions, and the ability to provide these regions as common variant files (VCF, MAF, BED)
> 4. Selecting reads by motif matching
> 5. Ability to count numbers of reads that satisfy any number of user-defined properties
> 6. Read and write CRAM files
> 7. Selectively strip alignment tags

VariantBam is implemented in C++ and uses the HTSlibrary from Heng Li, a highly optimized C library used as the core of Samtools and BCFtools.

Example
-------

We ran VariantBam like this:

```bash
options=(
    --input-bam         big.bam
    --output-bam        small.bam
    --rules-file        rules.vb
    --verbose        	
    --strip-tags	OQ,BI     
    --proc-regions-file example.bed
)
variant ${options[*]}
```

To get a full list of options, run ``variant --help``.

NEW: Can provide samtools-style syntax for regions:
```variant <bam> -g 7:145,000,000-146,000,000 -r mapq[10,100]```

Rules Script Syntax
------

This section will describe the syntax used by VariantBam to specify the cascades of rules and regions 
applied to a BAM. Below is an example of a valid VariantBam script:

```bash
    ### this is a comment. The line code below defines filters to be applied to each region/rule
    region@WG
    !hardclip;mapped;mapped_mate;isize[0,600];!mapq[10,100]
    !hardclip;mapped;mapped_mate;clip[10,101]
```

##### Region

Let's look first at the ``region`` tag. The region@ keyword marks that what follows is a genomic region, 
which is either the keyword ``WG`` for whole genome, or a VCF, MAF, Callstats or BED file. Regions are 
treated such that they will include any read who overlaps it, even partially. Optionally,
you can specify that your region of interest is a bit bigger than is actually in the file. You can do this by "padding"
the regions around the sites. For example:

``pad[1000];region@myvcf.vcf``

You can also state that the region applies to reads who don't necessarily overlap the region, but their pair-mate does (called "mate-linking"). Note that this only applies to the ``all`` target.
This is particularly useful for extracting all read PAIRS that cover a variant site.

``pad[1000];mlregion@myvcf``

Note that the syntax is such that you must specify the file immediately after the @. 

##### Rules


Rules are supplied as a list of criteria that a read must satisfy.
Note that you can take the complement of a condition 
by prefixing with a ``!``. For example:

```bash
    # do not include hardclipped reads, reads with isize > 600, or reads with mapq between 10 and 100.
    !hardclip;isize[0,600];!mapq[10,100]
    
    # an equivalent specification would be
    !hardclip;mapped;!isize[601,250000000];mapq[0,9]``
```

VariantBam handles multiple rules in the following way. For each read, VariantBam 
will cycle through the rules within a region until the read satisfies a rule. When it 
does, it includes the read in the output and stops checking. The logic for the entire collection of 
rules is then as follows:

On a given rule line, the read must satisfy ALL conditions (logical AND)

Across different rules, the read nead only satisfy ONE rule (logical OR)

To illustrate this, note that there is a small discrepancy in the first rule of the above. In the BAM format, 
unmapped reads and reads with unmapped mates are given an insert size of 0. However, in the same rule 
a condition is described to keep all reads with insert sizes 0-600 inclusive. Recalling the AND logic
within a rule, VariantBam will exclude the read, because it fails the ``mapped`` criteria.

Below is another example which uses the ability of VariantBam to interpret VCFs and BED files,
and apply rules separately to them.

```bash
    ### declare that region is a VCF file with pads of 1000 on either side of the variant.
    ### use the "mate" keyword to specify that pairs whose mate falls in the region belong to this rule
    region@/home/unix/jwala/myvcf.vcf;mate;pad[1000]
    #### I want to keep all the reads (this the default). Ill be explicit with the "every" keyword
    all
    #### A BED file which gives a list of exons. In here, I just want to keep "variant" reads
    region@/home/unix/jwala/myexonlist.bed 
    ## keep discordant reads
    !isize[0,600];
    ## keep only unmapped reads and their mates
    !mapped;!mapped_mate
    ## or keep if it is hardclipped
    hardclip
    ## keep reads with a mismatch to reference, but with high mapq
    nm[1,101];mapq[30,100]
    
```

##### Global

To reduce redundancy, you can also type a ``global@`` rule anywhere in the stack,
and it will append that rule to everything below. For example, to exclude hardclipped, duplicate, qcfail and 
supplementary reads in every region, you would do:

```bash
    global@!hardclip;!duplicate;!qcfail;!supplementary
    region@WG
    !isize[0,600]
    clip[10,101];mapq[1,60]
    region@myvcf.vcf
```

which is equivalent to

```bash
    region@WG
    !isize[0,600];!hardclip;!duplicate;!qcfail;!supplementary
    clip[10,101];mapq[1,60];!hardclip;!duplicate;!qcfail;!supplementary
    region@myvcf.vcf
    !hardclip;!duplicate;!qcfail;!supplementary
```
	
The global tag will apply through all of the regions. If you want to reset it for everything, just add ``global@all`` 
back onto the stack.

To make things run a little faster, you can set the order so that the more inclusive regions / rules are first. This only
applies if there is an overlap among regions. This is because VariantBam will move down the list of regions
that apply to this read and stop as soon as it meets an inclusion criteria. I prefer to start with a whole-genome region / rule
set, and then add more fine-mapped regions later.

##### Command Line Script

The usual method of inputing rules is with a VariantBam script as a text file (passed to
VariantBam with the ``-r`` flag). However, sometimes it is useful to not have to write an intermediate
file and just feed rules directly in. In that case, just pass a string literal to the ``-r, -g, -l`` flags, and VariantBam
will parse directly. ``-r`` will append a new rule, ``-g`` will append a new region and ``-l`` will append a new mate-linke regions. 
You can separate rule lines with either a new ``-r`` flag or with a ``%``. For instance, you might run something like the following:

```bash
variant big.bam -o small.bam -r 'global@!hardclip' -g WG -r '!isize[0,600];%clip[10,101];mapq[1,60]' -l 'myvcf.vcf' 
```

Note the single quotes so that it is interpreted as a string literal in BASH.
