Aho-Corasick Library 1.6
------------------------

This folder contain the implementation of Aho-Corasick library.

The Ahoâ€“Corasick algorithm is a string searching algorithm invented by 
Alfred V. Aho and Margaret J. Corasick. It is a kind of dictionary-matching algorithm that 
locates elements of a finite set of strings (the "dictionary") within an input text. 
It matches all patterns simultaneously.


COMPILE
-------
$ cd ahocorasick
$ make


HOW TO USE
----------
See example0, example1 and example2 to find out how to use the ahocorasick library.
you could also find more practical guides in the multifast program.
it is recommended to read the comments in the actypes.h and ahocorasick.c
to get a better understanding of its internals.
